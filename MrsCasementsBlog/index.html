			<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong></p> 
			<p>Projects, speeches were <strong>professional and expert!!</strong></p> 
			<p>All Classes:</p> 
			<p><em>Your projects were interesting, the speeches were informative.&nbsp; </em>&nbsp;Your writing and speaking is now the work of high school students.&nbsp; Take a moment to think about how you have grown as a student since September.&nbsp; Amazing isn’t it!</p> 
			<p>Now, let’s reflect on the unit of study, People Who Changed the World.&nbsp; Please think and synthesize your learning and connect with the learning of your classmates.&nbsp; Learning produces learning.&nbsp; Write about the experience and&nbsp;your learning when&nbsp;you answer&nbsp;the following&nbsp;nine questions.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline">Please place the number of the question at the margin and then answer the question.</span></p> 
			<ol> 
			  <li>If it was possible, what advice would the person you studied share with you today?</li> 
			  <li>Did you like/enjoy/admire the person you studied?&nbsp; Share your thinking.</li> 
			  <li>After listening to the speeches, what person, other than your own, did you find interesting and fascinating?&nbsp; Explain your thinking.</li> 
			  <li>After listening to the speeches, which person unexpectedly amazed you?&nbsp;(Chose a person other than your answer for #2.)&nbsp;Why?</li> 
			  <li>Examine your notes of the presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review the qualities each of the people possessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;–What are the similar qualities these people possessed?&nbsp; — Did you note any person who had unique qualities?&nbsp; –Which qualities reviewed in the speeches&nbsp;are the same as those possessed by your person?&nbsp;&nbsp;–Explain how one acquires these qualities?</li> 
			  <li>From The People Who Changed the World presented in your class, what common characteristics surprised you?&nbsp; Why do these qualities and characteristics build People Who Change the World?</li> 
			  <li>What is <strong><em>the</em></strong> <em><strong>one element</strong></em> you believe is necessary to be a “World Changer”? &nbsp;Explain your thinking that brought you to this idea.</li> 
			  <li>Synthesize your learning!&nbsp; Decide what is the overall knowledge you take away from the unit and share your thinking with us.</li> 
			  <li>How have you become a high school reader and writer?&nbsp; What can you do to continue to improve your skills and your accomplishments?</li> 
			</ol> 
			<p>All students, THINK…THINK…THINK about the ways you will continue to become the educated people who will create a better world for yourselves and others.&nbsp; It’s EXCITING!!</p> 
			<p>Thank you – we enjoyed the unit too.</p> 
			<p>This is a long blog and will be 300 points.&nbsp; It is due on or before&nbsp;Wednesday, March 1&nbsp;at 3:00pm. Please place answers in the comment box.</p>

			<p>Charles Dickens once stated, “There is a wisdom of the head, and a wisdom of the heart.”&nbsp; Analyze how the author conveys this idea in his novel,&nbsp; GREAT EXPECTATIONS?&nbsp; How could we apply this idea to our own lives?</p> 
			<p>You have completed a complex novel, GREAT EXPECTATIONS.&nbsp; Reflect on your learning.&nbsp; Share two life lessons&nbsp;you have&nbsp;learned from this novel?&nbsp; Predict which one of Dickens’ ideas you will be able to apply to your own life of “great expectations”.</p> 
			<p>Would you classify Dickens as a man who changed his world?&nbsp; Explain why or why not with at least one piece of evidence.</p> 
			<p>Select one powerful word or one powerful quote that impressed you during the unit.&nbsp; Analyze why the word or quote is so powerful.&nbsp; Recommend the word(s) for others’ thinking.&nbsp; What did you learn about the need to focus on powerful passages while reading?&nbsp; How will you read and track meaningful and important quotes during the next book?</p>

			<p>Hello Periods 3, 5,8, and 9,</p> 
			<p>Great&nbsp;job on the projects! I am anxious to see your&nbsp;work as the year progresses.</p> 
			<p>Kino looked into the pearl and dreamed of many things. &nbsp;&nbsp;As you dream about your future, what are your plans? What do you hope your future will be?&nbsp;&nbsp; What are two goals you hope to attain?</p> 
			<p>As you&nbsp;ponder your future, what life lesson did&nbsp;John Steinbeck&nbsp;show you?&nbsp;&nbsp;State one other&nbsp;life lesson the novella conveyed.</p> 
			<p>Did you “see” more in the novella at the end of the unit than you did over the summer? Did you become a better student of literature during the discussions, project and essay? Why/why not? Please share.&nbsp; Identify one powerful word in Steinbeck’s work or one you chose writing your project.&nbsp; Why was it powerful.</p> 
			<p>Next, we will&nbsp; read another book&nbsp;containing a&nbsp;character&nbsp;who is unhappy and depressed&nbsp;because he&nbsp;wants extreme wealth. In addition, the story will have a character that has extreme wealth but she is unhappy and depressed.&nbsp;Think about the juxtaposition of these two life situations and the characters’ reactions. Think about THE PEARL and “The Necklace”. Can you project what will happen to these two characters?&nbsp; Are you able to think of a movie that&nbsp;featured unhappy character/s who wanted wealth or character/s who&nbsp;had wealth but were miserable?&nbsp; What happened? Decide after reading THE PEARL, what Steinbeck would believe to be our “great expectations”.</p> 
			<p>We have read&nbsp;about and discussed&nbsp;our next author, Charles Dickens.&nbsp; Identify and state two important aspects of his life.&nbsp; In addition select two crucial elements of the Victorian times.&nbsp; State how the four elements you chose are important and crucial. Predict how these four elements will influence Dickens’ writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it was the&nbsp;“best of times and the worst of times” should make&nbsp;an interesting plot with dynamic&nbsp;characters and thoughtful themes.&nbsp; Why?</p> 
			<p>Your blog will be&nbsp;200 points (approximately 25 minutes of writing).&nbsp; It is due&nbsp;Friday, Oct.&nbsp;21 at 3:00 pm. Remember your post will not be published immediately.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; It’s fun to see the posts&nbsp;appear.</p> 
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
